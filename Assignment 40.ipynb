    "Embedded feature selection methods integrate feature selection within the training process of a machine learning model. Unlike filter methods (independent of models) and wrapper methods (use models for evaluation), embedded methods leverage the model itself to assess feature importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regularization Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (Lasso): Introduces a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients of less important features towards zero, effectively removing them from the model. Features with non-zero coefficients are considered relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (Ridge): Shrinks all feature coefficients, reducing their magnitudes but not necessarily setting them to zero. Features with larger coefficients are considered more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tree-based methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees: At each node, the feature that best splits the data based on the target variable is chosen. Features that participate in more splits are considered more important.\n",

    "Random Forest: Ensembles multiple decision trees, where features contributing to impurity reduction are considered more relevant. Feature importance can be calculated based on the average decrease in impurity across all trees.\n",

    "1. Neglects Feature Interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter method analyzes features independently and doesn't consider how they might interact with each other.\n",
    "Important information about the target variable might be missed if features have synergistic or antagonistic effects that influence the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Potential for Suboptimal Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "By not considering interactions, the filter method might overlook features that are individually weak predictors but become highly relevant when combined with other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can lead to a suboptimal feature set, potentially impacting the performance of the final machine learning model.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Potential for Overfitting:\n",

    "Some filter methods, particularly those based on ranking features based on their individual correlation with the target variable, can introduce bias towards features having a high correlation, even if it's not necessarily a causal relationship.\n",
