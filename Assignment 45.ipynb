    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data to ensure the validity of its results. Here's a breakdown of these assumptions and methods to check them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "Checking: Plot the data visually (scatter plot) and observe the trend. Deviations from a straight line may indicate non-linearity.\n",
    "2. Independence of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: Errors (differences between predicted and actual values) are independent of each other.\n",
    "Checking: Analyze the residuals (errors) for serial correlation. Tests like the Durbin-Watson test can be used.\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "Checking: Plot the residuals against the predicted values. A random scatter suggests homoscedasticity, while funnel or fan-shaped patterns indicate non-constant variance.\n",
    "4. Normality of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The errors are normally distributed with a mean of zero.\n",
    "Checking: Use tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or visually assess the distribution of residuals using a histogram or Q-Q plot.\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: Independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "Checking: Calculate the correlation matrix of independent variables. High correlations (> 0.8) might suggest multicollinearity."

    "Intercept (β₀): If β₀ is negative (e.g., -100,000), it doesn't mean a house with zero square footage costs -$100,000, but rather helps position the regression line on the y-axis. The actual price of a house with zero square footage wouldn't be meaningful in this context."

    "How is Gradient Descent Used in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model training: In machine learning, models have learnable parameters (weights and biases). Gradient descent is used to adjust these parameters to minimize errors between the model's predictions and the true target values.\n",
    "Cost function: This function measures the errors or difference between the model's output and the true target values. Gradient descent helps the model \"learn\" by iteratively moving its parameters in the direction that decreases this error.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model's parameters. This gradient indicates the direction of the steepest increase in the cost function.\n",
    "Take a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient (i.e., down the slope). The size of this step is determined by a hyperparameter called the learning rate.\n",
    "Update the model's parameters based on the step size and gradient.\n",
    "Repeat this process until a minimum value (or local minimum) is reached, or convergence criteria are met."

    "When a non-linear relationship is suspected: If you have a strong reason to believe the relationship between variables isn't linear based on domain knowledge, visual inspection of the data, or other exploratory analyses, polynomial regression can be a better choice.\n",
