    "Reduced coefficient variance: By shrinking coefficients towards zero, Ridge Regression helps stabilize their estimates and reduce their variance, making them more reliable.\n",

If your dataset includes both continuous and categorical independent variables, some preprocessing steps are typically necessary to effectively use them in Ridge Regression.

    "Ridge Regression is sensitive to the scale of the features. Therefore, it's often beneficial to standardize the variables, bringing them to a similar scale. This helps prevent the regularization term from disproportionately penalizing certain features.\n",
    "Interaction Terms:\n",

Ridge Regression can handle multicollinearity to some extent, but if it's severe, you might consider using methods like Principal Component Regression (PCR) or Partial Least Squares (PLS)."
