    "Combines L1 and L2 penalties from Lasso and Ridge Regression.\n",
    "Shrinks coefficients towards zero:\n",
    "L1 penalty encourages sparsity like Lasso (some coefficients become zero).\n",
    "L2 penalty promotes stability like Ridge Regression (all coefficients shrink but rarely to zero).\n",
    "Balances the strengths of Lasso and Ridge, offering:\n",
    "Feature selection like Lasso.\n",
    "Improved stability with multicollinearity compared to Lasso.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Choosing optimal regularization parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha (Î±): Controls L1 penalty strength (similar to Lasso's lambda).\n",
    "L1 Ratio (r): Mixes L1 and L2 penalties (r=0: pure Lasso, r=1: pure Ridge).\n",
    "Grid search and cross-validation:\n",
    "Try different alpha and r combinations.\n",
    "Choose the combination with the best performance on a validation set.\n",
    "Information criteria (AIC, BIC):\n",
    "Use these criteria to find the combination that balances fit and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Advantages and Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved performance: Can outperform Lasso and Ridge in some cases.\n",
    "Feature selection: Identifies important features like Lasso.\n",
    "More stable: Less sensitive to multicollinearity compared to Lasso.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning multiple parameters: Requires finding the optimal alpha and r, increasing complexity compared to Lasso or Ridge.\n",
    "Interpretability: Can be challenging due to the combined effects of L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Common Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-dimensional data: When dealing with many features, feature selection is crucial.\n",
    "Multicollinearity: When features are highly correlated, Elastic Net offers stability.\n",
    "Interpretability is a priority: While more complex than Lasso, it can still provide insights into important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Interpreting Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Lasso, non-zero coefficients indicate important features.\n",
    "Interpretation is more complex due to the combined L1 and L2 effects.\n",
    "Use feature importance techniques alongside coefficient analysis for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Handling Missing Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing is crucial: Impute missing values before using Elastic Net.\n",
    "Common techniques: mean/median imputation, KNN imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Feature Selection with Elastic Net:\n",
    "\n",
    "Features with zero coefficients are considered not relevant and can be excluded.\n",
    "Use domain knowledge alongside the identified features for informed selection.\n",
    "Q8. Pickling and Unpickling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickling: Saves the trained model as a serialized object using modules like pickle or joblib.\n",
    "Unpickling: Loads the saved model object back into memory for future use.\n",
    "Q9. Purpose of Pickling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Saves trained models: Avoids retraining the model every time it's needed.\n",
    "Shares models: Enables sharing trained models with others for deployment or further analysis."
