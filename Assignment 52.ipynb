    "Q1. Grid Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Exhaustively evaluates a model's performance across a grid of hyperparameter combinations to find the optimal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "Defines a grid of values for each hyperparameter.\n",
    "Trains the model on each combination of hyperparameters within the grid.\n",
    "Evaluates the model's performance using a cross-validation scheme.\n",
    "Selects the hyperparameter combination that yields the best performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Grid Search CV vs. Random Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV: Systematic, tries every combination in the defined grid (can be computationally expensive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Search CV: Randomly selects hyperparameter combinations from a defined range (faster but less exhaustive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Grid Search CV: When dealing with fewer hyperparameters or when interpretability of the search process is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Random Search CV: When dealing with many hyperparameters or when computational efficiency is a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Data Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Occurs when information not available during prediction is unintentionally used during model training, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using future data points to train a model for predicting future events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Preventing Data Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate training, validation, and test sets: Ensure no information leakage between sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper data preprocessing: Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies before splitting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Careful feature engineering: Avoid introducing features based on future information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: A table summarizing the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information:\n",
    "True Positives (TP): Correctly classified positive cases.\n",
    "False Positives (FP): Incorrectly classified positive cases (Type I error).\n",
    "False Negatives (FN): Incorrectly classified negative cases (Type II error).\n",
    "True Negatives (TN): Correctly classified negative cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Precision vs. Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: Proportion of predicted positives that are actually true positives. (TP / (TP + FP))\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: Proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. (TP / (TP + FN))\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Interpreting Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "High TP and TN indicate good overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "High FP or FN indicate specific classification errors (e.g., misclassifying one class as another).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Confusion Matrix Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: (TP + TN) / (Total samples)\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: See Q6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: See Q6.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall (balances both metrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Accuracy vs. Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy provides a general overview but doesn't reveal specific types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion matrix offers detailed insights into the model's performance for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Identifying Biases and Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "A biased model may have high accuracy for the majority class but low performance for minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uneven distribution of classes in the confusion matrix can indicate potential biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall low accuracy or specific high error rates for certain classes might reveal limitations in the model's ability to generalize."
