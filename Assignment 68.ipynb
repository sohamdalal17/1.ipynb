    "Q1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalue (λ): A scalar value associated with a nonzero eigenvector (v) of a matrix (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvector (v): A non-zero vector that, when multiplied by the matrix (A), only scales the vector, not its direction: A * v = λ * v.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider matrix A = [[1, 2], [2, 1]], and vector v = [1, 1]. Solving A * v = λ * v gives λ = 3 and v = [1, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship to Eigen-Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen-decomposition involves finding all eigenvalues (λ) and their corresponding eigenvectors (v) of a matrix, essentially expressing the matrix as a combination of these eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",

    "Proof Sketch:\n",
    "\n",
    "If A has n linearly independent eigenvectors (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) with corresponding eigenvalues (λ_1, λ_2, ..., λ_n), we can form a matrix V by stacking these eigenvectors as columns: V = [v_1 | v_2 | ... | v_n]. Since the eigenvectors are independent, V is non-singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can show that A * V = V * diag(λ_1, λ_2, ..., λ_n), where diag(...) denotes a diagonal matrix with the listed elements on the diagonal. This demonstrates the diagonal decomposition of A.\n",

    "Eigenvectors: Non-zero vectors that define the directions along which the matrix transformation scales the data.\n",

    "Q7. Geometric Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the matrix A as a transformation that stretches, shrinks, or rotates vectors in space.\n",
