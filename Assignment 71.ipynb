    "Q1. Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Groups data points into a hierarchy of clusters, starting with individual points and iteratively merging or splitting them based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference from other techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning: K-means assigns points to predefined clusters; hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy, offering flexibility in choosing \n",

    "\n",
    "Density-based: Similar to density-based methods in allowing for clusters of irregular shapes, but hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchical structure.\n",

    "Q2. Types of Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Agglomerative: (Bottom-up) Starts with individual points and iteratively merges the most similar clusters based on a distance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Divisive: (Top-down) Starts with all points in one cluster and iteratively splits the cluster that maximizes a dissimilarity measure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Determines the \"distance\" between two clusters for merging/splitting decisions.\n",

    "Q4. Determining Number of Clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "No single \"best\" number. Common methods involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dendrogram analysis: Examining the dendrogram and identifying a level where the clusters become visually distinct.\n",

    "Gap statistic: Compares the within-cluster variance of different clusterings to a null distribution to identify an \"elbow\" point where adding more clusters does not provide significant improvement.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering can be applied to both numerical and categorical data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Numerical data: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, etc.\n",

    "Q7. Identifying Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the dendrogram: Clusters with long branches merging into other large clusters might contain outliers.\n",

    "Analyze individual clusters: Clusters with high within-cluster variance or containing data points significantly different from others may indicate outliers.\n",

    "Note: Hierarchical clustering doesn't explicitly identify outliers, but the analysis can highlight potential candidates for further investigation."
