    "Q1. Decision Tree Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to make categorical predictions. It works by recursively splitting the data based on features (attributes) until it arrives at a leaf node containing the predicted class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Mathematical Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by calculating an impurity measure (e.g., Gini index, Information gain) for each feature, which represents the disorder or randomness within the data regarding the target class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It chooses the feature that minimizes the impurity after splitting the data based on its values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues recursively on the resulting subsets, creating branches in the tree until a stopping criterion (e.g., reaching a minimum number of samples or achieving pure leaf nodes) is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Binary Classification with Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary classification problem (two classes), the leaf nodes will contain either \"Class 1\" or \"Class 2\" labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree guides the classification process by asking a series of questions about the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the answer to each question (feature value), the data point is directed down a specific branch towards the final prediction at the leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Geometric Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the features as axes in a multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each split in the decision tree creates a hyperplane (a decision boundary) that divides the space into regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data points falling within a specific region based on the sequence of splits are assigned the corresponding class label at the leaf node representing that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the model's performance by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels. It allows us to calculate various evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Example and Metric Calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted\tActual Positive\tActual Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive\tTrue Positive (TP)\tFalse Positive (FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative\tFalse Negative (FN)\tTrue Negative (TN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: TP / (TP + FP) - Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all the cases predicted as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: TP / (TP + FN) - Measures the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score: (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) - Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Choosing Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the appropriate metric depends on the relative importance of false positives and false negatives in your specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider factors like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost of misclassification: If incorrectly classifying a negative case is very costly (e.g., spam detection), prioritize recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data imbalance: In imbalanced datasets, accuracy might be misleading. Use precision, recall, F1-score, or class-specific metrics for a more informative evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Precision is crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions. A high false positive rate (mistakenly labeling legitimate transactions as fraudulent) can inconvenience users. Therefore, precision is crucial to minimize these false alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Recall is crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Diagnosing a disease. Missing a positive case (false negative) can have severe consequences. Therefore, recall is critical to ensure most actual cases are identified correctly."
